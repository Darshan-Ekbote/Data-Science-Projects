This repository contains following projects:

1] House Price Prediction (March 2021- March 2021)
This dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 and the task here is to create a machine learning model that can predict the house prices.

2] Insurance Forcast (Jan 2021 - Feb 2021)
This dataset contains personal medical costs based on certain number of factors like sex,smoking etc. So the goal of this project is that by taking inputs predict medical costs
It is done via Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

3] Titanic Survival Prediction  (Feb 2019 - March 2019)
The dataset contains details of the titanic passengers. The task here i: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

4] Mental Health Survey (Prediction) (March 2021 - March 2021)
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.The task here is to create a machine learning model that predicts if the treatment for mental health is required or not.

These projects demonstrates following skills- 

1] Exploratory Data Analysis.
